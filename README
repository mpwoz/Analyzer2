This program downloads projects from Github and performs analysis on them.

It downloads projects from github, then 
	counts lines of code, occurences of 
	keywords, and other stats and creates
	an HTML table to present the results.  


To use, configure setting in either of the "*.properties" files.  The fields
should be self-explanatory.

The application has downloading functionality, however this has been disabled
in the current version (since it took too long and wasn't necessary)

Enabling it is just a matter of uncommenting some lines in "App.java" which is
the main class.

In its current state, the program simply "analyzes" all the applications in
the provided folder ('downloaddir' in the property file) and outputs several
HTML tables with the results.  It provides file-by-file keyword results, 
a table with just the projects related to keywords, as well as a summary
file with some statistics.

**Note** The application will delete any projects that are smaller than the 
threshold LOC (lines of code) specified in the property file.  To change
this functionality, look at the Analyzer.java class and comment out that part.

Overall, this project isn't very well architected and ended up being a bit of
a mess.  For this I apologize, unfortunately time constraints prevented me from
going back and refactoring out my mistakes.  In the state it is now, the
program simply looks for keywords in projects downloaded from Github and 
outputs resulting HTML.
