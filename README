This program downloads projects from Github and performs analysis on them.

It downloads projects from github, then 
	counts lines of code, occurences of 
	keywords, and other stats and creates
	an HTML table to present the results.  


TASKS
	- Filter projects on CD by 'scala.actor'
		- LOC and description table for these
	
	- File-by-keyword tables for Akka actors
	
	
TODO

	- Overhaul : use some sort of message-passing or IPC pipes to separate downloader/analyzer/presenter components
		(not realistic at this point, but thought for next project )

	- restructure the way presenter works, goal:
		1) create an "output" object
		2) different outputs -- e.g. a table of all projects, or lists of project files->keywords they contain
		
	- Keep refactoring "Analyzer"
	
	- Reject short/irrelevant projects
	
	- Use JSoup in Downloader to find projects better than the current hacky way
	
	- Localize properties-handling to Application class, then just pass in the relevant values to the various sub-tools
